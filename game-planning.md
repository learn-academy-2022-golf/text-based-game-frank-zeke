# Story
A person gets separated from their family when nuclear Fallout begins and they is able to survive. Now they are trying to find their family.

They have a robot companion, (AI had to use all of its resources to protect you from the fallout creating a hard light shield) 

We start with a basic version of our game for the purpose of getting a functioning version that we can add onto

Basic version is not just for us the developers but also to accustom the player to the gameplay

Health/damage input/output

always show stats "on screen" and as time passes health drops as time passes 

# Refactoring:
Remove outer quotations from console output
Use "getters" and "setters"

# Actions:
Movement based 
item pickup/drop
item usage
